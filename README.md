## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of Power BI for visualizing and analyzing survey data. By combining DAX formulas, statistical methods, and interactive visualizations, we provided actionable insights into the survey participants' demographics, job roles, and preferences.

## Future Scope

Extend the analysis by incorporating more survey attributes.

Automate data refresh to update the dashboard dynamically.
